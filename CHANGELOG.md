# Changelog

All notable changes to Better Windows Services are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file is for people who use the tool. Changes that only matter to somebody working on
it - internal structure, measurements, test guards - are in
[CHANGELOG-DEV.md](CHANGELOG-DEV.md).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing has been released yet. Everything below is what the tool does today.

### Added

- **`bws list`** shows every entry the service control manager knows about, as a table for
  a person or with `--json` for a script. Drivers are included, which is why the count is
  larger than the one `services.msc` shows.
- **`--query`** narrows the listing with a language shared by the command line and, later,
  the window. Fields: `name`, `display`, `type`, `status`, `start`, `account`, `pid`,
  `trigger`, `path` and `file`. Values combine with spaces for "all of these" and commas
  for "any of these", `!` excludes, and `none`, `any` and `?` ask whether a field is empty,
  filled or could not be read. Text fields take wildcards and regular expressions. A bare
  word searches names, display names, accounts and launch paths.
- **`bws stop`, `bws start` and `bws restart`** carry out one named entry's change through
  a plan: what will happen, in what order, and what came of every step.
- **`--dry-run`** on every write command shows the plan and changes nothing.
- **`--dependents`** on `stop` and `restart` takes down the entries that would break as
  well. Without it the plan has one step and names who is standing in the way.
- **`--timeout`** caps how long any one step is watched. It is a ceiling, not a deadline:
  an entry that keeps reporting progress is given the time it asks for.
- **Trigger start is shown and searchable.** An entry that is set to start automatically,
  is not running, and waits for a trigger is doing what it was told to do rather than
  failing - the listing says `on trigger` and `--query trigger:any` finds them.
- **`--signatures` shows who signed each binary and whether Windows trusts it.** Off by
  default, because verifying a whole machine takes several seconds where the rest of a
  listing takes a third of one. A query about signatures switches it on by itself, so
  `--query "signed:no"` needs no flag. `signed:no` covers everything Windows would not run
  quietly - unsigned, expired, revoked, untrusted or tampered with - and each of those can
  be asked for by name. `publisher` finds who signed it, so `!publisher:microsoft` answers
  "what on this machine did not come from Microsoft".
- **The launch path is read, and a missing file is reported.** `--query file:missing` finds
  entries whose executable is not on disk, and `file:missing start:auto` is the orphan a
  cleanup would care about. The listing marks these `file missing` next to the start type.
- **`--timing`** reports how long reading took, on the error channel.
- **`--json`** output keeps data and diagnostics apart: only data goes to standard output,
  everything else to standard error, including when a run fails.
- **Exit codes** for scripts and monitoring: `0` done, `1` the tool failed, `2` the command
  was wrong, `3` the plan ran and something did not get where it was going, `4` somebody
  stopped the run by hand.
- **Ctrl+C has three levels**, each saying what the next one costs. The first stops going
  forward and still puts back what was taken. The second leaves things as they are and
  still prints the report. The third ends the process.
- **A refusal carries the system's number as well as its sentence.** The sentence is in the
  language of the machine, so the number is the half a script should read.

- **Privileges, service identity and permissions are read and searchable.** `--json` now
  carries `requiredPrivileges`, `sidType` and `securityDescriptor` for every entry, and the
  query language gained `privilege`, `sidtype` and `sddl`. `--query "privilege:debug"` finds
  everything that asked to keep the right to attach to any process, and
  `--query "sidtype:restricted"` finds the services running under the tighter kind of
  identity. Read on every listing, because all three together cost about a sixth of a
  second on a machine with 810 entries.
  - **A service that declares no privileges is not a restricted one.** Declaring them is
    how a service asks for the rest to be taken away, so declaring none keeps everything
    the account has.
  - The permissions come as the text form Windows itself reads and writes, with owner,
    group and the permission list. It differs from `sc sdshow` in two ways on purpose: it
    has the owner and group, which `sc` does not print, and not the audit list, which needs
    a privilege that even an administrator session does not have switched on.
  - Not shown in the table. The three would add width to every row without changing what
    any existing column means, and the listing is already wide.

- **`--memory` shows how much memory each running entry's process is using.** A `MEMORY`
  column, and `requiredPrivileges`-style detail in `--json` with both the working set and
  the commit figure. `--query "memory:>100MB"` finds the heavy ones and switches the
  reading on by itself.
  - **A number belonging to several services says so.** Services sharing one process all
    report that process's memory, which is correct and adds up to several times the truth -
    so the cell reads `36.1 MB (shared by 5)` and the machine readable output carries the
    count alongside the figures.
  - Sizes in a query need their unit: `memory:>500MB`, `memory:<1GB`, `memory:100MB-1GB`.
    Writing `memory:>500` is refused with a message rather than read as 500 bytes, which
    would match every running service while looking like it had filtered. Units are powers
    of 1024, the same as Task Manager and `Get-Process`.
  - Off by default, and not to save time - it takes a few milliseconds. It is the one thing
    the tool reports that is a measurement rather than a setting, so a plain listing stays a
    description of how the machine is configured.

- **`bws snapshot create` freezes the whole machine into a file you can keep.**

  ```
  bws snapshot create before-the-deployment.json --note "before the deployment"
  ```

  JSON, one field per line, keys in a fixed order, so two snapshots of an unchanged machine
  differ in exactly one line - the time. Put them in a repository and `git diff` tells you
  what a patch Tuesday did. Without a file name it writes one into the current directory,
  named after the machine and the moment.
  - **Always complete.** Signatures and a SHA-256 of every binary are read every time. A
    listing skips them for speed and a snapshot cannot: one without them, compared against
    one with them, would report the whole machine as changed.
  - **The file says how it was taken** - machine, operating system, time, who ran it, and
    whether they had administrator rights. That last one matters: without elevation Windows
    hands over fewer entries, so comparing such a snapshot against an elevated one would
    show services as removed that nobody removed. The tool says so when it writes one.
  - **Written safely.** The file appears complete or not at all, never half-written, and a
    failed write leaves whatever was there untouched. Pointing it at a directory that does
    not exist is refused rather than created.
  - Memory is deliberately not in it. It is different a second later and would be noise in a
    document whose whole purpose is being compared with another one.

- **Three more things about every entry**, in `--json` as well as in snapshots:
  `errorControl` (how hard Windows takes it when the entry fails during boot),
  `loadOrderGroup`, and `binaryHash`.

- **Non-English names print as themselves in `--json`.** Display names on a Polish or German
  install used to come out as escape sequences - correct JSON that nobody could check
  against `services.msc`.

- **`bws snapshot diff EARLIER LATER`** says what changed between two snapshots, field by
  field. It answers two of the three comparisons this tool is for: what a patch Tuesday did,
  and why staging and production behave differently.
  - **Configuration and running state are reported apart.** Two snapshots taken a day apart
    differ in what was running on dozens of entries, and none of that is drift. Printed
    together they bury the handful of settings that actually moved.
  - **What could not be compared is said, never skipped.** An entry only one of the two
    snapshots could see is listed as "cannot tell" rather than as removed - without
    administrator rights Windows hands over fewer entries, so a missing one may never have
    been removed. A field one snapshot could not read is named beside its entry instead of
    being reported as a change from a value to nothing.
  - **`--exit-code`** ends with code 5 when anything differs, for a pipeline step that has to
    fail on drift. Off by default, so a script that only wants the differences printed is not
    tripped by finding some. Entries nobody could see and fields nobody could read do not
    count as differences.
  - **`--json`** gives the same comparison for a script, with a `differs` flag that answers
    the same question as the exit code.
  - **`--live`** compares the file against this machine as it is now, which answers "what
    changed since that snapshot". It reads signatures and hashes like `snapshot create`
    does, because the file on the other side has them.
  - Without `--live` it reads two files and nothing else. Comparing two snapshots does not
    touch the service control manager, so it needs no rights over the machine running it.
  - **A note for anything running this on a schedule:** on a live machine the running state
    moves on its own. Entries start themselves for their own reasons within minutes, which
    is why what is running and how things are set up are reported apart.

- **There is a window.** It opens, reads the machine and shows every entry the service
  control manager knows about, with its name, display name, status, start type, account and
  process id. It is dark, and dark is the only way it comes.
  - **A value that could not be read does not look like a value that is not there.** An empty
    cell means the service genuinely has none. Anything else says so in words, because those
    two facts say opposite things about a service and a blank cell cannot tell you which.
  - Read only. Every change to a service goes through a plan, so there is nothing here to
    type into.
  - The list does not refresh itself yet, and cannot be searched or sorted. Those are the
    next steps.

### Changed

- **The delayed start setting is now recorded for every service, not only automatic ones.**
  Windows lets you mark any service as delayed, and it only does anything on an automatic
  one - but it is stored either way, and a snapshot that could not see it would miss the
  moment somebody set it. Eight services on the machine this was measured on carry the
  setting while not being automatic, `WinRM` and `MSDTC` among them.
  - The listing still marks `(delayed)` only where it changes what the start type means.
    Writing it next to `Manual` would claim something the setting does not do there.
  - `--json` and snapshots now carry `delayedAuto` for every service rather than `null` for
    most of them. `sc qc` does not show it outside automatic services, and neither does the
    table - the difference is in what gets recorded, not in what gets claimed.

- **Taking a snapshot is about four times faster.** `bws snapshot create` measured
  5.5-9.1 seconds and now measures 1.7-2.1 seconds on a machine with 810 entries and 544
  distinct binaries. It reads exactly the same things and reports exactly the same answers -
  a snapshot taken by the old version and one taken by this one differ only in their
  timestamp. `bws list --signatures` and any query about signatures got the same speed-up,
  since they do the same work.
  - The gain comes from asking about several files at once rather than one after another.
    How many at once follows the number of processors, so a small machine asks for less.
  - Times will differ on your machine. The number of services, the speed of the disk and how
    many binaries are signed through a Windows catalogue all move it.

### Fixed

- **The usage text lists every switch again.** `--signatures` was missing from it, and
  `--timing` was shown only for `list` although it works everywhere.
- **A switch given without its value says so**, instead of reporting itself as an unknown
  option and sending you looking for a typo you did not make.
- **One unreadable file no longer ends the whole run.** A binary whose certificate cannot
  be parsed now costs its own answer, reported as unreadable, rather than the other eight
  hundred entries and a failing exit code.
- **The program no longer claims to be version 1.0.0.** Nothing had ever declared a
  version, so the build tools filled one in. It now reports `0.1.0`, which is what an
  unreleased tool should say.

### Known limits

- Local machine only. Remote management is not in this version.
- Windows only, 64-bit only, Windows Server 2019 or Windows 10 1809 and above.
- Operations on drivers are refused rather than attempted.
- The tool does not raise its own privileges. When the manager refuses, it says so and
  ends with exit code 3.
- For a service hosted inside `svchost`, the launch path names the host, so "the file is
  there" and "who signed it" both say less than they do for a service with a process of
  its own.
- Certificate revocation is not checked. It would need to reach the network, and this tool
  never does.
- Where a file carries both its own signature and an entry in a Windows catalogue, and the
  two name different signers, the publisher shown is the one inside the file. That can
  differ from what PowerShell reports, and it is the one that stays the same when the file
  is looked at on another machine.
